## Deployment Commands
```bash
# Build production images
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml build

# Run security scan
bandit -r src/
safety check

# Run performance tests
locust -f tests/performance/locustfile.py

# Deploy to production
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d

# Check deployment health
curl https://api.lapis-spider.com/health

# View logs
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml logs -f

# Scale workers
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml scale celery-worker=5

# Backup database
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml exec postgres pg_dump -U postgres lapis_spider > backup.sql

# Monitor metrics
open http://monitoring.lapis-spider.com/grafana
```

## Rollback Procedure
1. Identify the issue in production
2. Stop affected services: `docker-compose stop [service]`
3. Revert to previous image: `docker-compose up -d --force-recreate [service]`
4. Verify system health
5. Investigate root cause
6. Plan fix deployment
